**DEPRECATED** Examples have been moved into the react-detect-print repository directly. This example is for an oudated version of react-detect-print.

Example usage of [react-detect-print](https://github.com/tacomanator/react-detect-print), a higher order component to detect if the page is being printed.

## Running

```
npm install
npm start
```

Your browser should open to the address `http://localhost:3000`. Try printing and you should see that the value of `printing` changes to `true` on the printed page.
